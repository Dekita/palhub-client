#### Application Cache Directory
![alt text](/img/app-setup-help/app-cache-dir.png)

The application cache directory should point to an empty folder on your computer. This is where mod files will be downloaded and stored, before they are installed to the game directory.

DO NOT SET THIS TO BE THE PATH TO YOUR GAME!!

Enter your unique API Key for PalHUB Client from Nexus Mods. You should NOT use a Personal API Key for PalHUB Client, or the API Key for any other Nexus Mods supported mod manager application as this may cause issues when downloading mods.

#### Open Nexus Mods Links

Once enabled, the application MUST be restarted for the changes to take effect. After restart, the application will respond whenever you click 'Mod Manager Download' on any specific mod page on Nexus Mods.

This will initiate a download of the specific mod file that you have clicked, and is the only way for non-premium Nexus Mods users to download mods when using PalHUB Client.

NOTE: Only one application can acively listen for 'Mod Manager Download' buttons from nexus mods. If you currenly use Vortex or any other mod manager software that uses this feature, enabling it for this application may disable it for others (closing this application and opening your other app; Vortex for example, should restore functionality).

Once you enter a valid path to a supported game; Palworld, FF7R, etc. You will be able to download and install UE4SS to that games directory, should the game require it. (UE4SS is optional for some games)

![alt text](/img/app-setup-help/setup-new-game-found.png) 

After UE4SS is installed you are all setup and ready to begin using PalHUB Client to manage the mods for your selected game. UE4SS Config options can dramatically affect how the system interacts with your game, because of this you should NOT alter the UE4SS Config options unless you FULLY understand the changes you are making!! PalHUB Client will apply the most common and stable configuration for supported games to ensure a smooth experience for everyday users.
