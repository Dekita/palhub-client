### Why Does This Happen?! 
Because a few years ago windows decided they wanted $250/yr for a windows code signing license!! I'm just a small developer who, unfortunately, doesnt have that kind of spare cash. 


### How To Be Sure The App Is Safe??
Easy! Before you fully run the installer, drop the setup.exe file into the [Virus Total Website](https://www.virustotal.com)! Virus Total will then scan the file with over 50 different antivirus scanners and report the results.. If you encounter a Virus Total report with multiple antivirus vendors suggesting the application is malicious, please report it immediately via [discord](https://discord.gg/WyTdramBkm)!
