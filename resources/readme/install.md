### Why Does This Happen?! 
Because a few years ago windows decided they wanted $250/yr for a windows code signing license. I'm just a small developer who, unfortunately, doesnt have that kind of spare cash. :'( 


### How To Be Sure The App Is Safe??
Easy! If you have any doubts, before you fully run the installer, drop the setup.exe file into the [Virus Total Website](https://www.virustotal.com)! Virus Total will then scan the file with over 50 different antivirus scanners and report the results..

The antivirus Bkav Pro *may* show a false positive for `W32.AIDetectMalware`. According to security researchers at hackerdose.com; 
`"This is quite typical for installation files like Setup.exe and Setup.msi. Weâ€™ve also seen it on legitimate utility software installations that came from the official source and executable file plugins for well-known products like music mixing and editing software. This identification is especially prevalent when downloading files via torrents or third-party installers."`
